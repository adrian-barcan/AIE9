    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicity's sake."

      "Hello! The best way to write a loop in Python depends on what you want to achieve, but generally, using a `for` loop or a `while` loop is common. Here’s a kind and simple overview:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **For Loop** – When you want to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range of numbers):\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "for i in range(5):\n",
      "    print(i)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This will print numbers 0 to 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **While Loop** – When you want to repeat something until a condition is no longer true:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "count = 0\n",
      "while count < 5:\n",
      "    print(count)\n",
      "    count += 1\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This also prints numbers 0 to 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tips for writing good loops:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Choose `for` loops for iterating over sequences or a known number of times.\n",
      "- Use `while` loops when the number of iterations depends on a condition.\n",
      "- Make sure the loop will eventually end (to avoid infinite loops).\n",
      "- Keep the loop body clear and readable.\n",

    "Enhance your Personal Wellness Assistant in some way! \n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestions are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **PDF Support**: Allow it to ingest wellness PDFs (meal plans, workout guides, medical information sheets)\n",
    "- **New Distance Metric**: Implement a different similarity measure - does it improve retrieval for health queries?\n",
    "- **Metadata Support**: Add metadata like topic categories (exercise, nutrition, sleep) or difficulty levels to help filter results\n",
    "- **Different Embedding Model**: Try a different embedding model - does domain-specific tuning help for health content?\n",
    "- **Multi-Source Ingestion**: Add the capability to ingest content from YouTube health videos, podcasts, or health blogs\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Maintaining Physical and Psychological Health**: Individuals need to ensure both physical and mental health are well maintained. Being physically healthy allows focusing on other well-being aspects, and being mentally sound helps in implementing measures to promote well-being (Source 1, Source 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diet and Nutrition**: Consuming a healthy and nutritious diet is an indispensable factor for well-being. A good diet leads to effective growth and development and supports overall health (Source 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Addressing Social Determinants**: Factors such as poverty, unemployment, homelessness, illiteracy, and unawareness negatively impact health and well-being. Eliminating or reducing these problems is crucial for promoting better livelihood opportunities and well-being (Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Ensuring Good Living Conditions**: Fundamental aspects such as housing, financial resources, employment opportunities, education, competencies, skills, and abilities are significant in promoting well-being. Focusing on these factors throughout life is important (Source 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Mental Health Management**: Being well-equipped with measures and approaches to curb and prevent issues like depression, frustration, and anxiety is important so they do not escalate and negatively affect health and well-being (Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
