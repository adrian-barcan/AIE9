## 🏗️ How AIM Does Assignments

> 📅 **Assignments will always be released to students as live class begins.** We will never release assignments early.

Each assignment will have a few of the following categories of exercises:

- ❓ **Questions** – these will be questions that you will be expected to gather the answer to! These can appear as general questions, or questions meant to spark a discussion in your breakout rooms!

- 🏗️ **Activities** – these will be work or coding activities meant to reinforce specific concepts or theory components.

- 🚧 **Advanced Builds (optional)** – Take on a challenge! These builds require you to create something with minimal guidance outside of the documentation. Completing an Advanced Build earns full credit in place of doing the base assignment notebook questions/activities.

### Main Assignment

In the following assignment, you are required to take the app that you created for the AIE9 challenge (from [this repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge)) and conduct what is known, colloquially, as a "vibe check" on the application.

You will be required to submit a link to your GitHub, as well as screenshots of the completed "vibe checks" through the provided Google Form!

> NOTE: This will require you to make updates to your personal class repository, instructions on that process can be found [here](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE9/tree/main/00_Docs/Prerequisites/Initial_Setup)!


#### A Note on Vibe Checking

>"Vibe checking" is an informal term for cursory unstructured and non-comprehensive evaluation of LLM-powered systems. The idea is to loosely evaluate our system to cover significant and crucial functions where failure would be immediately noticeable and severe.
>
>In essence, it's a first look to ensure your system isn't experiencing catastrophic failure.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #1: General Vibe Checking Evals

Please evaluate your system on the following questions:

1. Explain the concept of object-oriented programming in simple terms to a complete beginner.
    - Aspect Tested: The ability of the LLM to explain a technical concept in simple terms. 
    The prompt evaluates the AI skill in breaking down a specialized technical subject like OOP in an easy to understand format with multiple examples. 
2. Read the following paragraph and provide a concise summary of the key points…
    - Aspect Tested: Reading Comprehension and Summarization. 
    This task evaluates the AI ability to process a paragraph and determine the most important points, creating a summary that reflects the main idea of the original input. 
3. Write a short, imaginative story (100–150 words) about a robot finding friendship in an unexpected place.
    - Aspect Tested: Creative Writing and Narrative Generation. 
    This task evaluates the AI ability to generate an unique story with a simple plot. The generated story was within the limits, with 137 words.
4. If a store sells apples in packs of 4 and oranges in packs of 3, how many packs of each do I need to buy to get exactly 12 apples and 9 oranges?
    - Aspect Tested: Logic and Basic Math Skills
    This task evaluated the LLM ability to understand the problem, identify the correct math operations and do the basic math.
5. Rewrite the following paragraph in a professional, formal tone…
    - Aspect Tested: Tone and Style
    This task is testing if the application can adapt an informal paragraph into a more professional text.

#### ❓Question #1:

Do the answers appear to be correct and useful?
##### ✅ Answer: Yes, the answers are correct and useful. The LLM demonstrates good judgment about when to ask clarifying questions, provides accurate information, and adapts its response style to different types of requests. The quality is consistently high across creative, technical, and practical tasks. The conversational style ("You've got this," "Nicely done!") is appropriate for a Mental Coach.  

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #2: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Your Assistant Can Answer)

Now test your assistant with personal questions it should be able to help with. Try prompts like:

- "Help me think through the pros and cons of [enter decision you're working on making]."
- "What are the pros and cons of [job A] versus [job B] as the next step in my career?"
- "Draft a polite follow-up [email, text message, chat message] to a [enter person details] who hasn't responded."
- "Help me plan a birthday surprise for [person]."
- "What can I cook with [enter ingredients] in fridge."

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What are the pros and cons of working from home versus going into the office every day?
   - Result: 
   Great question. The “right” setup depends on your role, personality, home setup, and priorities. Here’s a clear view to help you decide.

    Working from home
    Pros
    - No commute: saves time, money, and energy.
    - Flexibility: align work with your energy, personal needs, and family.
    - Deep focus: potentially fewer interruptions; control your environment.
    - Comfort/ergonomics: tailor your workspace; easier to manage health needs.
    - Geographic freedom: live where you prefer.

    Cons
    - Blurred boundaries: overwork or difficulty switching off.
    - Isolation: fewer casual interactions; weaker sense of belonging.
    - Visibility/career: less “in the room” exposure; harder informal networking.
    - Collaboration friction: fewer spontaneous ideas; more scheduling.
    - Home distractions or poor workspace; tech/security issues.

    Going into the office
    Pros
    - Social connection: easier relationships, culture, and belonging.
    - Faster collaboration: quick questions, whiteboarding, serendipity.
    - Clear boundaries: work and home separation can protect downtime.
    - Learning/mentoring: “osmosis” from peers; useful for early-career roles.
    - Visibility: easier to build trust and reputation with leadership.

    Cons
    - Commute: time, cost, stress; less flexibility.
    - Interruptions/noise: can reduce deep work.
    - Less control: lighting/noise, temperature, shared spaces.
    - Fixed schedules: harder to align with personal energy or caregiving.
    - Illness exposure and extra daily expenses.

    Hybrid (mix of both)
    Pros
    - Balance deep work at home with collaboration in-office.
    - Intentional office days for mentoring, brainstorming, social ties.
    Cons
    - Coordination overhead; risk of remote participants being sidelined.
    - Requires clear norms to avoid “two-tier” experience.

    How to choose: quick decision lenses
    - Role: heavy individual/deep work → more WFH; heavy collaboration/client-facing/leadership → more office.
    - Career stage: early-career or new to a company benefits from more office; established ICs often thrive remote.
    - Personality and mental health: need stimulation/accountability → more office; need quiet/autonomy → more WFH.
    - Home setup: good workspace and few distractions → WFH works better.
    - Commute: long and draining → favor WFH; short/easy → office becomes more attractive.
    - Company norms: if leadership values face time, some office presence helps visibility.

    Try a low-risk experiment
    - Run a 2–4 week trial. Assign office days to collaboration/social/mentoring; WFH days to deep work.
    - Track: energy (start/end of day), focus, output, mood, and connection. Adjust the ratio.

    Make either option work better
    - If working from home:
    - Dedicated workspace; start/stop rituals; clear core hours.
    - Over-communicate progress; document decisions; schedule social touchpoints.
    - Ergonomic setup; movement and daylight breaks; occasional co-working or coffee chats.
    - If going to the office:
    - Protect focus blocks; use noise-canceling headphones.
    - Batch in-person meetings and networking to “earn” the commute.
    - Optimize commute (podcasts, cycling), prep meals, and plan recovery time.

If you’d like, tell me your role, commute, home setup, and top 3 priorities (e.g., focus, flexibility, career visibility, social connection, family time). I can suggest a tailored weekly plan.
2. Prompt: Help me plan a city break in Rome
   - Result: 
   I’d love to help you design a Rome city break that feels energizing, not exhausting. Here’s a starter plan you can use right away, plus quick questions so I can tailor it perfectly.

    Quick questions to personalize
    - How many days and when are you going?
    - Pace: relaxed, balanced, or see-it-all?
    - Top interests: ancient history, art, food/wine, neighborhoods, shopping, religious sites, nightlife?
    - Budget and preferred vibe for lodging (boutique, central, quiet, family-run)?
    - Any mobility/dietary needs?

    3-day balanced itinerary (swap days as you like)
    Day 1 – Historic heart and Trastevere
    - Morning: Pantheon (small entry fee; go early), Piazza Navona, Campo de’ Fiori. Coffee at the bar like a local.
    - Lunch: classic Roman pasta (cacio e pepe, carbonara) near Jewish Ghetto; try carciofi when in season.
    - Afternoon: Trevi Fountain, Spanish Steps, stroll to Pincio Terrace for city views in Villa Borghese.
    - Evening: Cross to Trastevere for aperitivo and dinner. Optional: Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere, gelato, wander cobblestone lanes.

    Day 2 – Ancient Rome and Monti
    - Morning: Colosseum + Roman Forum + Palatine Hill (prebook timed entry on the official site; go early).
    - Lunch: Monti neighborhood (great trattorie and bakeries).
    - Afternoon: Capitoline Hill lookout over the Forum; optional Capitoline Museums. Coffee break; feet up.
    - Evening: Monti wine bar or rooftop near Piazza Venezia. Night stroll past the illuminated Forum.

    Day 3 – Vatican or Appian Way (choose your vibe)
    Option A: Vatican and Prati
    - Early: St. Peter’s Basilica (dress code: shoulders/knees covered); optional dome climb.
    - Late afternoon: Vatican Museums + Sistine Chapel (book a late slot to avoid peak crowds).
    - Sunset: Castel Sant’Angelo bridge, aperitivo in Prati.

    Option B: Nature + ruins reset
    - Morning: Appian Way (Via Appia Antica) by bike or on foot; catacombs tour.
    - Afternoon: Testaccio Market for food stalls; Pyramid and street art walk.
    - Evening: Tiber riverside or Gianicolo/Janiculum Hill for sunset.

    If you love art: reserve Galleria Borghese (timed, 2-hour slots). If you love food: consider a cooking class or a Trastevere/Testaccio food tour.

    What to book in advance (minimize lines)
    - Colosseum/Forum/Palatine combo (official site; choose early slot; consider arena/underground if available).
    - Vatican Museums timed entry (most Sundays closed; late-afternoon slots are calmer).
    - Galleria Borghese (mandatory reservation).
    - Pantheon timed ticket if you prefer; or visit early.
    - Popular restaurants for dinner (especially Thu–Sun).

    Where to stay (area cues)
    - Centro Storico (Pantheon/Navona/Trevi): walk-everywhere, lively.
    - Trastevere: charming, nightlife, cobbles.
    - Monti: village feel near Colosseum, great food.
    - Prati: calm, wide streets, near Vatican, good for families.
    - Testaccio/Aventine: authentic, food-forward, quieter nights.
    Tip: You won’t need a car; historic center has restricted driving (ZTL).

    Getting in and around
    - Airports: FCO taxi fixed fare ~€50 to central zone; Ciampino ~€31. Leonardo Express train to Termini from FCO; regional trains reach Trastevere/Tiburtina.
    - Transit: Metro A/B/C, buses, trams. You can tap contactless cards on gates. 72-hour passes exist. Rome is very walkable; allow extra time for traffic.
    - Taxis: official ranks or apps like Free Now; avoid unmarked cars.
    - Pickpockets: keep valuables in front/zippered pockets, especially in crowds.

    Food and drink pointers
    - Must-tries: supplì, pizza al taglio, cacio e pepe, amatriciana, carciofi (in season), saltimbocca, maritozzi, gelato (look for natural colors).
    - Coffee: order and drink at the bar for speed/price; cappuccino before 11 a.m. is the local norm.
    - Aperitivo: Monti, Trastevere, Prati are great.
    - Reservations help; avoid places with aggressive touts or huge multilingual menus.
    - Tipping: service often included; rounding up or small change is fine.

    Practical + wellbeing tips
    - Wear comfy shoes; streets are cobbled. Refill water at “nasoni” fountains.
    - Sun and heat: hat, sunscreen, midday break. Aim big sights early or late.
    - Churches: modest dress; carry a light scarf.
    - Keep some buffer time each day—Rome rewards slow wandering.
    - Quiet recharge spots: Giardino degli Aranci (Orange Garden), cloister of San Giovanni in Laterano, Villa Borghese lawns, early morning by the Tiber.

    Passes and savings
    - Roma Pass 72h can be worth it if you’ll visit 2 paid sites and use transit a lot; you still need to reserve Colosseum time slots separately for a small fee.

    Ballpark budget (per person, per day, mid-range)
    - Lodging: €150–300 per room
    - Meals: €35–70 (more with wine/fine dining)
    - Tickets/activities: €20–40
    - Local transport: €7–12 (less if mostly walking)

    If you share your dates, pace, and interests, I’ll refine this into a day-by-day plan with specific time slots, restaurant picks near each stop, and booking links to the official sites—so you can relax and just enjoy la dolce vita.
3. Prompt: Help me find an unique idea for a financial application that is useful for many people
   - Result:
   Love that you’re aiming for something broadly useful. Here’s a unique, high-impact concept you can build lean and iterate on fast.

    Idea: ShiftPay Planner – a cashflow coach for hourly and gig workers
    One-liner: Turn variable shifts and gigs into a predictable, stress-free monthly plan by forecasting income at the shift level and auto-choreographing bills so overdrafts never happen.

    Who it helps
    - Hourly workers, gig workers, tip-based earners, multi-job folks, students with part-time work, caregivers with irregular hours.

    Core pain it solves
    - Unpredictable income makes budgeting futile; bills don’t line up with paydays; people get hit with overdrafts, late fees, and anxiety.

    How it works (core features)
    - Shift-level income forecasting: Connect to scheduling and gig apps or input shifts manually. Predict net pay per shift, including taxes, tips, mileage, and expected cancellations.
    - Bill choreography: Automatically rearranges bill due dates or creates smart pay plans so payments land right after pay hits. Warns you when a bill is at risk and suggests a fix.
    - Envelope auto-funding: Buckets for rent, food, transport, debt. Fills them dynamically after each shift’s pay settles, not just on fixed paydays.
    - Minimum-hours coach: Tells you the exact number and best timing of shifts you need to accept this week to stay on track for upcoming bills and goals.
    - Effective hourly rate insights: Compares gigs/locations by net take-home after commute time, parking, gas, and fees.
    - Tax-safety tracker: Tracks quarterly tax needs for multi-gig earners and reserves a smart percentage from each payout so tax time isn’t a crisis.
    - Calm mode: When income dips, auto-pauses low-priority envelopes and negotiates flexible bill dates; when income rises, tops up emergency and debt snowball automatically.

    Why it’s different
    - Income-first instead of spend-first: Built for irregular pay, not retrofitting a fixed-budget model.
    - Real-time, actionable coaching: Tells you which shifts to take, when, and what that means for bills—today.
    - Multi-source income support: Works across multiple employers/gigs; most apps don’t handle that cleanly.
    - Predictive, not just descriptive: Prevents overdrafts and late fees proactively.

    MVP in 4–8 weeks
    - Bank connection (Plaid) + manual shift entry + bill import.
    - Simple net pay estimator by shift (hours x rate x tips estimate) and a cashflow timeline.
    - Alerts for “bill at risk” and a one-tap plan (delay discretionary envelope, suggest one extra shift).
    - Basic envelope auto-funding after deposits.

    V2 integrations
    - Work/schedule/earnings: Argyle, Pinwheel, Finch; gig APIs (Uber, DoorDash, Instacart).
    - Billers: Prism-style bill fetch or user upload + due date negotiation partners.
    - Tax estimates: simple withholding logic for W-2 and 1099.

    Monetization
    - Freemium: core forecasting and alerts free.
    - Premium ($4–7/mo): advanced integrations, automated bill date changes, tax reserve automation, multi-gig insights.
    - Employer partnerships: offer as a benefit to reduce financial stress and turnover.
    - Ethical optional boosts: savings rate boosts via banking partners (no predatory advances).

    Go-to-market
    - Start with communities heavy in shift work: hospitality, retail, rideshare groups, nursing assistants.
    - Partnerships with scheduling apps, worker centers, unions, and creator influencers who speak to gig life.
    - “Never miss rent again” and “Know the exact shifts you need this week” as key messages.

    Success metrics
    - Reduction in overdrafts/late fees per user.
    - On-time bill payment rate.
    - Days of cash buffer built.
    - Active users linking at least two income sources.
    - Net promoter score and retention at 90 days.

    Risks and mitigations
    - Forecast accuracy: Start transparent with confidence bands; improve via user feedback and historical patterns.
    - API costs: Limit polling, prioritize most-used integrations, encourage manual entry early.
    - Liability perception: Clear disclaimers + conservative defaults; never auto-pay without user consent.
    - Trust/privacy: Bank-grade security, no data selling, clear permissions, local processing where possible.

    If this resonates, I can help you shape the MVP scope, user stories, and a 2-week prototype plan. To tailor it even more, tell me:
    - Who do you most want to help first (gig drivers, retail, restaurant, healthcare)?
    - Do you prefer a consumer subscription or employer-partner model?
    - What’s your target platform for the MVP (mobile-first, web, or both)?

#### ❓Question #2:

Are the vibes of this assistant's answers aligned with your vibes? Why or why not?
##### ✅ Answer: The assistant's answers are mostly alligned with my vibes. The assistant provides genuinely useful and actionable information but a bit too verbose. The tone feels slighty too corporate/formal.

---

#### 🏗️ Activity #3: Personal Vibe Checking Evals (Requires Additional Capabilities)

Now test your assistant with questions that would require capabilities beyond basic chat, such as access to external tools, APIs, or real-time data. Try prompts like:

- "What does my schedule look like tomorrow?"
- "What time should I leave for the airport?"

##### Your Prompts and Results:
1. Prompt: What time should I leave for work tomorrow?
    - Result: 
    Happy to help you pick a leave time that feels calm instead of rushed. A good answer depends on a few things: what time you need to be at work, how you’re getting there, how long the trip usually takes (and how much it swings on a bad day), whether you need extra time for parking/security/elevators, and how early you like to arrive.

    Can you share:
    - Your required arrival time (and whether there’s a first‑thing meeting)
    - Your commute mode and typical duration, plus the worst‑case you’ve seen
    - Any add‑ons tomorrow (drop‑offs, coffee, parking, weather)
    - Whether you prefer to be 5–10 minutes early or okay with right-on-time

    If you want a quick rule of thumb right now: choose the time you want to be at your desk, subtract your usual commute, subtract 5–10 minutes for parking/entry, then subtract a buffer (10–15 minutes if being on time matters or traffic is variable). If you’re unsure, leaving about 15 minutes earlier than whatever normally gets you there on time is a safe default; make it 20–25 minutes earlier if you’ve got a first‑thing meeting.

    If you give me the details, I’ll help you pin down a specific leave time and a simple plan B in case the morning goes sideways.
2. Prompt: Do I have any important meetings on Friday?
   - Result:
    I don’t have access to your calendar, so I can’t see your Friday schedule. Which Friday do you mean (date), and what calendar do you use? If you paste your Friday events here, I’ll help you quickly flag what’s truly important and what can be shortened, delegated, or moved.

    As a quick filter while you check: a meeting is “important” if it ties directly to a key goal, requires a decision or deliverable from you, or others are depending on you to unblock something. If you share the list, I’ll help you sort it and suggest any prep you might need.

#### ❓Question #3:

What are some limitations of your application?
##### ✅ Answer: The application does not have access to external tools or any context about my work schedule or my meetings.

---

This "vibe check" now serves as a baseline, of sorts, to help understand what holes your application has.

### 🚧 Advanced Build (OPTIONAL):

Please make adjustments to your application that you believe will improve the vibe check you completed above, then deploy the changes to your Vercel domain [(see these instructions from your Challenge project)](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/The-AI-Engineer-Challenge/blob/main/README.md) and redo the above vibe check.

> NOTE: You may reach for improving the model, changing the prompt, or any other method.

#### 🏗️ Activity #1
##### Adjustments Made:
- I have improved the message prompt by adding more detail, including specific dos and don'ts for the AI.
- I have added in-memory conversation history, stored in an array and passed from FE to BE on each request


##### Results:
1. The resulted response of the OOP prompt was more conversational and less like robot explaing sumething.
2. The creative writing was more natural.
3. The results were less verbose and less formal. More like a friend discussing about different topics.
4. The format without bullet points makes results seem more friendly and natural.
5. With the in-memory conversation history, additional details can be added to the existing conversation in order to get a more detailed and accurate response
