    "- Supervisor State (Middle Level): Manages the delegation strategy. It receives the brief from the Agent State and spawns multiple Researchers\n",
    "- Researcher State (Bottom Level): Independent, isolated states for each parallel subagent to conduct specific research and tool usage\n",

    "Why not a single huge state?\n",

Separate states allow researchers to do their detailed work, compress the results, and pass only the summary back up the chain\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Keeps the notebook clean: By moving the heavy lifting (like the state definitions and graph construction) into external files, the notebook itself is much easier to read and focus on the high-level workflow. It doesn't get cluttered with hundreds of lines of implementation code\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Harder to learn the details: To understand exactly how something like the supervisor node works, I have to constantly context-switch and open the .py files instead of just scrolling up to see the code definition right there in a cell\n",
    "- Slower experimentation: If I want to tweak a prompt or change a tool's logic to see what happens, I can't just edit a cell and hit run. I have to edit the file, save it, and often restart the kernel to get the changes to reload"

    "\n",
    "2. What it is designed to accomplish\n",
    "This prompt orchestrates the \"brain\" of the operation. Instead of trying to answer the question directly, it acts as a manager with the following goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze the complexity of the user's request\n",
    "- Decompose the problem into parallelizable chunks (if necessary)\n",
    "- Delegate specific research tasks to sub-agents via the ConductResearch tool\n",
    "- Aggregate results and decide when sufficient information has been found to stop\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Key techniques used\n",
    "- Role prompting: It explicitly defines the persona: \"Think like a research manager with limited time and resources.\" This discourages the model from going down rabbit holes and encourages efficiency.\n",
    "- Explicit Constraints: It sets firm boundaries to prevent infinite loops and token waste, such as \"Limit tool calls... always stop after {max_researcher_iterations}\" and \"Bias towards single agent\"\n",
    "- Sequential Reasoning (CoT Enforcement): It forces a \"Think, then Act\" workflow by mandating the use of the think_tool before delegating and after receiving results. This forces the model to generate a chain-of-thought trace in the context window before committing to an action\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Suggested Improvement\n",
    "Add a \"Cross-Check\" step. Currently, the supervisor delegates tasks and then checks if it has \"enough\" info. It might be beneficial to explicitly instruct the supervisor to check for conflicting information between sub-agents. We can add a step in the <Show Your Thinking> section: \"If multiple researchers return conflicting data (e.g., different dates for the same event), explicitly formulate a new query to resolve the conflict before marking research as complete.\""

       "## Understanding Your Sleep Challenges\n",
       "\n",
       "Your three primary sleep issues—inconsistent bedtimes, phone use in bed, and morning fatigue—are interconnected problems rooted in circadian rhythm disruption and poor sleep hygiene practices. Research shows that sleep consistency refers to maintaining the same bedtime and wake-up time within 30 minutes, including weekends, and this consistency is crucial for health, safety, and performance [1]. A 2023 study found that students with irregular sleep patterns had lower academic performance and more mental health challenges than peers with consistent sleep, even when both groups slept for similar durations [2].\n",
       "\n",
       "The 3-hour variability in your bedtime (10pm-1am) significantly disrupts your circadian rhythm, which requires daily adjustment since the endogenous human physiological cycle is slightly longer than 24 hours. This coordination is achieved through the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the anterior hypothalamus, your body's central pacemaker [3]. When this system is disrupted by irregular timing and blue light exposure from devices, it creates a cascade of sleep problems including difficulty falling asleep, poor sleep quality, and morning fatigue.\n",

       "### The Science of Sleep Consistency\n",
       "\n",
       "The circadian photoreceptor system shows peak sensitivity to 450-480 nm light within the blue spectrum, which accounts for blue light's high efficacy in suppressing melatonin and increasing alertness [4]. Your inconsistent bedtime pattern suggests a delayed sleep-wake phase, which affects up to 78% of individuals with sleep timing issues. Research indicates that approximately 40% of people with delayed sleep phase disorder have a family history of circadian rhythm sleep disorders [5].\n",

       "### Evidence-Based Schedule Fixing Protocol\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 1: Establish a Fixed Wake-Up Time First**\n",
       "Research demonstrates that focusing first on establishing a fixed wake-up time is more effective than trying to control bedtime. Choose a wake-up time that allows for at least 7-9 hours of sleep and maintain it every day, including weekends [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 2: Gradual Bedtime Adjustment**\n",
       "Make gradual adjustments in 15-30 minute increments over several days rather than dramatic changes. If you're currently going to bed at 1am but want to sleep by 10pm, move your bedtime 30 minutes earlier every 2-3 days until you reach your target [6].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Step 3: Light Exposure Timing**\n",
       "Light exposure is the most powerful zeitgeber (time cue) for circadian rhythms. Studies show that morning light exposure can advance sleep timing, while evening light delays it. A week of natural light-dark cycle exposure advanced dim light melatonin onset (DLMO) by approximately 2.6 hours in healthy adults [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Chronotherapy and Advanced Timing Interventions\n",
       "\n",
       "For severe timing issues, chronotherapy involves gradually postponing sleep time by 3 hours every 2-5 days until reaching the desired schedule. However, this requires careful planning and is typically done under medical supervision [5]. A more practical approach combines morning bright light therapy with evening light restriction. Studies using 10,000 lux morning light therapy showed phase advances of 31 minutes in DLMO and 57 minutes in mid-sleep time [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Managing Electronic Device Use Before Bedtime\n",
       "\n",
       "### The Blue Light Problem\n",
       "\n",
       "Multiple studies demonstrate that blue light exposure suppresses melatonin secretion and exacerbates sleep problems. Evening exposure to LED-backlit devices can suppress and delay melatonin production, making it significantly harder to fall asleep [4]. A systematic review found that blue light exposure decreased sleep quality in one-fifth of studies and decreased sleep duration in one-third of studies [8].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Evidence-Based Device Management Strategies\n",
       "\n",
       "**Complete Device Elimination Protocol**\n",
       "The most effective approach is complete elimination of screens 1-2 hours before bedtime. Reserve this hour for wind-down activities away from stimulating content [9]. Replace phone use with reading physical books, gentle stretching, meditation, or other relaxing activities.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Blue Light Filtering Solutions**\n",
       "If complete elimination isn't immediately feasible, research shows specific interventions can help:\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Blue Light Blocking Glasses**: A randomized controlled trial found that wearing amber-tinted blue light-blocking lenses for 2 hours before bedtime for 7 consecutive nights significantly improved multiple sleep measures, including sleep quality, duration, soundness, and reduced overall sleep distress [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Device Settings**: Use \"warm\" lighting settings on devices. Studies show that \"cool\" white LED lights caused 12.3% melatonin suppression compared to just 3.6% for \"warm\" white LEDs. Tunable LED devices can reduce estimated melatonin suppression from 10% at cool settings to just 0.1% at warm settings [10].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Environmental Light Management**\n",
       "Research indicates that only brown-tinted blue light filtering solutions proved highly effective, reducing estimated melatonin suppression to below 0.3%. Additionally, bedroom lighting should transition to warm, dim lighting 2-3 hours before bedtime [10].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Addressing Morning Fatigue and Sleep Quality Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "### Understanding Sleep Architecture and Morning Fatigue\n",
       "\n",
       "Morning fatigue despite adequate sleep duration typically indicates poor sleep quality or disrupted sleep architecture. Sleep architecture consists of 4-6 cycles lasting 90-120 minutes each, including Non-REM sleep (light stages 1-2 and deep slow-wave stage 3) and REM sleep. Research published in Sleep Medicine Reviews demonstrates that sleep quality is just as important as sleep duration for feeling refreshed [11].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Sleep Inertia and Cortisol Response\n",
       "\n",
       "Sleep inertia, the grogginess experienced upon waking, was first identified among U.S. Air Force pilots in the 1950s. It's most likely to occur with sudden awakening or insufficient sleep and may last from minutes to over an hour [12]. This is often related to disrupted cortisol awakening response, which should peak within 30-45 minutes after morning awakening and then decline throughout the day.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Strategies for Reducing Morning Fatigue\n",
       "\n",
       "**Optimize Sleep Timing**\n",
       "Waking during lighter sleep stages reduces sleep inertia. While you can't control this precisely without sleep tracking devices, maintaining consistent timing helps your body naturally optimize awakening timing.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Address Sleep Architecture Issues**\n",
       "Deep sleep is when your body repairs tissues, strengthens immunity, and consolidates memories. Insufficient deep sleep leads to morning fatigue regardless of total duration [11]. Factors that improve deep sleep include:\n",
       "- Consistent sleep timing\n",
       "- Optimal bedroom temperature (65°F/18.3°C)\n",
       "- Complete darkness\n",
       "- Minimal noise disruption\n",
       "- Regular exercise (but not within 3-4 hours of bedtime)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Morning Light Exposure**\n",
       "Immediate bright light exposure upon awakening helps establish proper cortisol awakening response and reinforces circadian timing. Studies show this can advance sleep phase and improve morning alertness [7].\n",
       "\n",
       "## Bedroom Environment Optimization\n",
       "\n",
       "### Temperature Control\n",
       "\n",
       "Research consistently shows that people sleep better when their bedroom is optimized for temperature. Any healthy adult experiences a natural drop in body temperature during sleep, which occurs during initial sleep stages because lower core temperature promotes sleepiness. Many experts agree that 65°F (18.3°C) is the ideal bedroom temperature, though this may seem cool, it helps maintain lower core temperature during sleep [13].\n",
       "\n",
       "### Noise Management\n",
       "\n",
       "Studies demonstrate that even low-level noise can cause shifts to lighter sleep stages or momentary awakenings. Research examining bedroom environmental factors found that sleep efficiency was significantly related to noise levels (P <.0001), with noise having a -1.85% impact on sleep efficacy after statistical adjustment [14]. Strategies include:\n",
       "- Use of white noise machines or earplugs\n",
       "- Heavy curtains or sound-dampening materials\n",
       "- Addressing sources of intermittent noise\n",
       "\n",
       "### Light Control\n",
       "\n",
       "Circadian rhythms are heavily influenced by light and darkness. During the day, sunlight signals the brain to produce cortisol for alertness, while darkness triggers melatonin production for sleepiness. Artificial light exposure in the evening delays circadian rhythms and prolongs sleep onset [13]. Create complete darkness using blackout curtains, eye masks, and elimination of LED indicator lights from electronics.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Air Quality Considerations\n",
       "\n",
       "Recent research shows that bedroom air quality significantly affects sleep. In fully adjusted statistical models, sleep efficacy was related to PM2.5 particles (P <.05), CO2 levels (P <.05), and temperature (P <.05). After statistical transformation, sleep efficacy decreased by 2.15% with PM2.5 exposure and 1.73% with temperature increases [14]. Consider air purifiers and adequate ventilation.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Comprehensive Implementation Plan\n",
       "\n",
       "### Phase 1: Immediate Changes (Week 1-2)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sleep Timing Foundation**\n",
       "- Choose a fixed wake-up time that allows 7-9 hours of sleep\n",
       "- Set this wake-up time for every day, including weekends\n",
       "- Begin moving bedtime 30 minutes earlier every 2-3 days if currently going to bed after 11pm\n",
       "\n",
       "**Device Management**\n",
       "- Implement complete phone/device ban in the bedroom\n",
       "- Charge devices in another room\n",
       "- Replace bedtime phone use with reading, gentle stretching, or meditation\n",
       "- If immediate elimination isn't possible, use amber-tinted blue light blocking glasses 2 hours before bedtime\n",
       "\n",
       "**Environment Setup**\n",
       "- Set bedroom temperature to 65°F (18.3°C)\n",
       "- Install blackout curtains or use eye masks\n",
       "- Remove or cover LED lights from electronics\n",
       "- Ensure bedroom is as quiet as possible\n",
       "\n",
       "### Phase 2: Optimization (Week 3-4)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Light Exposure Protocol**\n",
       "- Get bright light exposure within 30 minutes of waking (natural sunlight preferred, or 10,000 lux light therapy device)\n",
       "- Dim all lights to warm settings 2-3 hours before bedtime\n",
       "- Use only amber or red lighting in evening hours\n",
       "\n",
       "**Sleep Hygiene Refinement**\n",
       "- Establish a consistent 1-hour pre-sleep routine including relaxing activities\n",
       "- Avoid caffeine after 2pm\n",
       "- Avoid large meals, alcohol, and intense exercise within 3-4 hours of bedtime\n",
       "- Consider room temperature water beside bed to avoid middle-of-night searches\n",
       "\n",
       "### Phase 3: Advanced Interventions (Week 5+)\n",
       "\n",
       "**Circadian Support**\n",
       "- If sleep timing issues persist, consider low-dose melatonin (0.5-3mg) taken 2-3 hours before desired bedtime, but consult healthcare provider first\n",
       "- Track sleep patterns to identify optimal timing\n",
       "- Consider morning exercise to strengthen circadian signals\n",
       "\n",
       "**Environmental Fine-Tuning**\n",
       "- Address air quality with purifiers or plants if needed\n",
       "- Experiment with white noise or earplugs for noise management\n",
       "- Ensure mattress and pillows support comfortable, uninterrupted sleep\n",
       "\n",
       "### Monitoring and Adjustment\n",
       "\n",
       "Track your sleep using a simple log noting bedtime, wake time, sleep quality (1-10 scale), morning fatigue levels, and any deviations from the protocol. Research shows that knowledge alone doesn't translate to improved sleep quality—it requires behavioral change and planned actions for success [15]. Sleep is highly individual, highlighting why precision medicine approaches are key to sleep hygiene success.\n",
       "\n",
       "Expect gradual improvement over 2-4 weeks rather than immediate results. Studies indicate that circadian rhythm adjustments take time, with some interventions showing effects within days while others require weeks of consistency. The key is maintaining the protocol even when results aren't immediately apparent, as circadian rhythm entrainment is a gradual biological process.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### Answer:\n",
    "Trade-offs of Parallel vs Sequential Research:\n",
    "- Speed vs. Cost/Complexity: Parallel is faster because you can have 5 agents searching 5 different topics at once. The downside occurs in complexity and potential rate-limiting. You burn through tokens much faster in a short burst, which might hit API limits or cost more per minute.\n",
    "- Context Isolation: In parallel research, Agent A doesn't know what Agent B is finding until the end. In sequential research, Agent B can learn from what Agent A found and adjust its search strategy, which is better for \"follow-up\" type investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other:\n",
    "- Choose Parallel when you have distinct, non-overlapping topics. For example, \"Compare the pricing of AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.\" You don't need to know AWS's price to look up Azure's. It's distinct lists or comparisons.\n",
    "- Choose Sequential when the research is a \"chain\" of dependencies. For example, \"Find out who the CEO of Company X is, and then find their recent interviews.\" You can't do the second part until the first part is done."

    "##### Answer:\n",
    "To adapt this for a production wellness application, we would need several critical additions beyond the prototype:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safety & Medical Disclaimers: Since this is health-related, we need a robust moderation layer. We can't just let the LLM give advice unchecked. We'd need a \"Safety Check\" node that runs before the final report to ensure no harmful or hallucinations of medical advice are output.\n",
    "- User Context Integration (The \"Wellness Profile\"): Instead of just taking a raw query, the system should pull from a user database. If I ask for a diet plan, it should already know my allergies, age, and activity level. This would be a \"Context Retrieval\" node added to the start of the graph.\n",
    "- Persistence: The current MemorySaver is in-memory and temporary. For production, we need a lasting database (like Postgres with langgraph-checkpoint-postgres) so users can pause a research task and come back to it days later.\n",
    "- Caching: Many users will ask similar questions (e.g., \"how to sleep better\"). We don't want to pay for all the web searches every single time. A semantic cache would check if a similar research report already exists before starting a new one.\n",
    "- Feedback Loop: We need a way for users to rate the advice. This feedback should be saved and used to fine-tune the supervisor or researcher prompts over time."
